### **Day Trading Plan: XAU/USD (Gold)**  
**Strategy:** ICT (Inner Circle Trader)  
**Market:** CFD (Contract for Difference)  
**Instrument:** XAU/USD (Gold)

#### **1. Trading Hours**  
- **Preferred session:** London Open, New York Open (high volatility times).  
- **Timeframe:** 1-hour and 15-minute charts for direction; 5-minute chart for entries.  

#### **2. Risk Management**  
- **Risk per trade:** 1-2% of account equity.  
- **Stop-loss:** Set below/above significant swing highs/lows (using liquidity zones from the ICT concept).  
- **Target:** Use ICT models to target liquidity pools above/below swing highs/lows (aim for 2R or more).  

#### **3. Daily Bias**  
- **Market bias:** Determine the daily bias using market structure and higher-timeframe ICT concepts (e.g., market maker buy/sell model, weekly profiles).  
- **Key levels:** Identify daily/weekly key levels and liquidity zones.  
- **News events:** Check economic calendar for high-impact news that may affect gold.

#### **4. ICT Strategy**  
- **Market structure shift:** Watch for shifts in structure that indicate bullish or bearish moves.  
- **Order blocks:** Identify and use ICT order blocks (bullish or bearish) on the 15-minute chart for entry points.  
- **Fair value gaps:** Look for fair value gaps (imbalances) on the 1-hour and 15-minute charts as entry zones.  
- **Optimal trade entry (OTE):** Use Fibonacci retracements (61.8%-79% zones) for optimal entries within the identified price structure.

#### **5. Entry Criteria**  
- **Confirm daily bias:** Ensure market structure aligns with your bias.  
- **Market structure break:** Confirm a break of structure on the 5-minute chart.  
- **Order block test:** Wait for price to retrace to a valid order block, fair value gap, or optimal entry level.  
- **Confirmation:** Look for confluence of factors like liquidity sweeps, order block retests, or bullish/bearish divergence.  
- **Entry:** Place the trade with a stop-loss above/below the order block or liquidity sweep zone.

#### **6. Exit Strategy**  
- **Partial take profits:** Exit 50% of position at the nearest liquidity target (swing high/low or previous dayâ€™s high/low).  
- **Final take profit:** Close remaining position near the next significant liquidity pool or major support/resistance.  
- **Time-based exit:** If the trade is not moving favorably within 1-2 hours, consider exiting early.  

#### **7. Post-Trade Review**  
- **Document the trade:** Record the entry, exit, and rationale behind the trade.  
- **Review:** Analyze what worked and what could be improved. Focus on adhering to the plan and refining strategy execution.
