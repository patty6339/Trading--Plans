### **Day Trading Plan: XAU/USD (Gold) – Asian Session**  
**Strategy:** ICT (Inner Circle Trader)  
**Market:** CFD (Contract for Difference)  
**Instrument:** XAU/USD (Gold)  
**Session:** Asian 

#### **1. Trading Hours**  
- **Key times:** Focus on 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM EAT (East African Time).  
- **Timeframes:**  
  - Use **M15** to identify liquidity raids (highs/lows).  
  - Use **M1** for market structure shifts and precise entries.  

#### **2. Risk Management**  
- **Risk per trade:** 0.5%-1% of account equity.  
- **Stop-loss:** Place stop below/above the price high/low that has been raided.  
- **Target:** Aim for a 3R (Risk-to-Reward Ratio of 3:1).  

#### **3. Market Preparation**  
- **Mark key levels:** On the M15 chart, mark the section between 3:00 AM and 5:00 AM EAT using vertical lines
- **Liquidity sweep:** Wait for price after 3 am and before 5 am to raid either the high or the low formed before 3 am

#### **4. Entry Strategy**  
- **Shift to M1 timeframe** once the price has raided the high or low on M15.  
- **Market structure shift:** Look for a shift in market structure on M1 (indicating a potential reversal after the liquidity sweep).  
- **Fair value gap (FVG):** Identify a fair value gap (price imbalance) and wait for price to retest this area.  
- **Entry:** Enter the trade at the retest of the fair value gap.  

#### **5. Exit Strategy**  
- **Stop-loss:** Set the stop-loss just below the low (for longs) or above the high (for shorts) of the raid level.  
- **Target:** Use 3R as the primary target (3 times your risk).  
- **Early exit:** If market conditions reverse or become unfavorable, consider reducing position size or exiting early.  

#### **6. Post-Trade Review**  
- **Record the trade:** Document the rationale for entry, exit, and trade outcome.  
- **Analyze:** Review the success of the trade and areas for improvement. Focus on timing, entry, and adherence to the plan.
